Initial Wire Frame

(Wire frame will be updated as project continues)

// The player will select "start game!" and the timer will begin.
Once the timer begins, the pet will begin to age, express sleepiness, boredom, and hunger. These will be referred to as pet functions.

    // Pet functions will be set at an interval to occur. The player must tend to the pet functions as they occur.
    // For now, selecting the wrong pet function, (or selecting no function at all) will increase the corresponding value by 1.
    // should one of the pet functions reach 10/10, the pet will die. 

// The player will select buttons to allow the pet to eat, sleep and play in order to keep the pet from dying.



// Timer drives majority of the pet functionality and interaction in the game. Should be main focus for now.

// The game will be built statically in HTML and styles in CSS first before JavaScript major functionality is added
// In HTML the start button needs to be a footer
// "eat", "sleep" and "play" buttons need to be added slightly above the start button on the footer.
// Footer needs border, background, and styling as well as positioning
