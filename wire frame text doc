//-----------------------------------------Player Story----------------------------------------------------------------------

// The player will select "start game!" and the timer will begin.
Once the timer begins, the pet will begin to age, express sleepiness, boredom, and hunger. These will be referred to as pet functions.

    // Pet functions will be set at an interval to occur. The player must tend to the pet functions as they occur.
    // For now, selecting the wrong pet function, (or selecting no function at all) will increase the corresponding value by 1.
    // should one of the pet functions reach 10/10, the pet will die and the game will end.

// The player will select buttons to allow the pet to eat, sleep and play in order to keep the pet from dying.


//------------------------------------Wire Frame and Planning------------------------------------------------------//


// Timer drives majority of the pet functionality and interaction in the game. 
// "eat", "sleep" and "play" buttons need to be added slightly above the start button on the footer.
// Footer needs border, background, and styling as well as positioning

    // The start button will also start the timer.
    // When the timer stops, so will the game.
    // The timer will stop if the pet is dead.
    // Instead of timer, add functional clock that logs to the console how long player kept pet alive.

// create separate repo for project
// create read.me file
// add to readme.file
// include app.js, index.html, and css files.
// Instructions
// Create object class
// begin to fill out object
// comment out code that Isn't working as intended. reference along the way
// Pet Metrics: Hunger(1-10); Sleepiness(1-10); Boredom(1-10)
    // create functions using this to increase or reduce sleepiness, boredom and hunger.
    // every x seconds 
    // if button is not clicked in x amount of time, decrement 1 from 10 in pet functions.

// create a function that increases pet age every x minutes.
// assign age to pet

// add ability to name pet
// add buttons to feed pet, turn off lights and play with pet.
// Increase pet's hunger, sleepiness, and boredom in intervals of your choosing
// Pet should die if Hunger, Boredom, Sleepiness hits 10/10

// Pet will morph at certain ages
// We can increment the age every x minutes 
//   ----or---- we can increment the age as a function of sleep
                age++ or age +1 

// Animate pet across the screen while it's alive.

// button class ID 
// Javascript Event Listeners for button clicks
// Alert! for when pet is hungry, sleepy, or bored
// Alert! for when pet sleeps, eats and plays.

// Background in css
// Tomagatchi character CSS
// Figure out how to animate pet
